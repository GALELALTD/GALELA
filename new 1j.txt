🔍 What Is a Fill-Up?

A Fill-Up is a prepaid fuel credit that allows you to purchase up to 80 litres of fuel — anytime, anywhere at participating Galela partner fuel stations.

Each time you use your Galela Card at the pump, one Fill-Up is used, no matter how much fuel you choose (up to the limit).

> ✅ 1 Fill-Up = 1 visit to the fuel station (up to 80L)
✅ Whether you take 20L or 80L, it counts as one Fill-Up
✅ Run out? Just top up your Fill-Ups online
✅ Fill-Ups are not cash-based, they're usage-based

🔥 Why Choose Galela Fill-Ups?

💰 Lower-Than-Market Fuel Prices

Galela negotiates lower fuel rates through bulk buying. That means:

You pay less per litre

The more Fill-Ups in your plan, the cheaper each one becomes


🛡 Predictable Fuel Spending

No surprise fuel bills

No worrying about fluctuating prices

Just load your Fill-Ups and go


🎯 80-Litre Cap for Maximum Value

Each Fill-Up lets you fuel up to 80 litres in one go.

Best used for full tanks to stretch your savings

If you try to exceed the cap, the transaction declines (keeping your usage in check)


🚫 Fuel-Only Protection

Your Galela Card will only work for fuel — not for snacks, drinks, or anything else at the station.

> That means no misuse, no confusion — just pure fuel.
